# Changelog

## 0.12.0 - 2026-09-01

- Added public non-DRM YouTube playback through pinned yt-dlp and Deno helpers.
- Added six curated game/anime examples with availability-change handling.
- Added English-only runtime/UI policy and simplified RTX 40/RTX 50 defaults.
- Added the optional experimental RenoDX neural-rendering path, enabled by
  default with a safe-mode escape hatch.
- Added pinned runtime hashes and fail-closed staging for the supplied DLSS
  310.8, ReShade, RenoDX, and Streamline binary set.
- Release binaries remain experimental: the modified neural DLL has an invalid
  Authenticode signature, RTX 50 hardware was not tested, and redistribution
  permission for the supplied runtime set is unresolved.

## 0.11.0 - 2026-08-29

- Added live post-DLSS image adjustments: brightness, contrast, saturation, gamma, temperature and tint.
- Added a dedicated Image Adjustments tool window and toolbar/menu entry.
- Added `Ctrl+Alt+C` overlay-safe global shortcut for Image Adjustments.
- Added paused-frame presentation heartbeat so ReShade remains responsive while playback is frozen without advancing video or NGX history.

- Added `WS_CLIPCHILDREN` / `WS_CLIPSIBLINGS` window composition changes for the video surface.
- Preserved image settings and language independently in `DLSSVideoPlayer.ini`.
- Restructured documentation and repository metadata for public GitHub use.

## 0.10.0 - 2026-08-29

- Added Windows-level transport hotkeys that continue working while ReShade captures normal input.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-08-29

- Added idle startup window, drag-and-drop, modern file picker and language packs.
